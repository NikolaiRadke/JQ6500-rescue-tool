# JQ6500 tool
  
If you want to compile the tool by yourself (maybe for an old 32Bit system), just open a terminal and type `make`.  
If you want to lern more about the modules and the tool, you can follow a discussion with the author Reinhard Max [here](https://www.mikrocontroller.net/topic/416088#5117893).
