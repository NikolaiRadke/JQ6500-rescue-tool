![JQ6500-16p](https://www.nikolairadke.de/NOKOlino/mp3modul.png)  
  
For JQ6500-16p owners with no Windows upload software on their device. 
  
Some of the **16MBit** and almost every **32MBit** variant come without the windows upload tool, that autostarts, when you plug in the device, makes them, espacially for Windows users, almost useless. Luckily, there ist an existing tool written by [Reinhard Max](https://chiselapp.com/user/rmax/repository/jq6500/home) - for **Linux**, but leaces Windows users alone.  
  
This repository provides all the helpless owners with two tools:  
* **Linux Users:** A tool to upload a **missing upload tool** or **MP3 files** to your device.  
* **Windows Users:** A very small **ISO-Image** with a simplified batch script for run the tool above on a **CDROM** or **USB stick**.
